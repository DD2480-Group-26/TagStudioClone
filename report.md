## Onboarding experience

Did you choose a new project or continue on the previous one?
For the assignment did we choose a different project. The experience was similar to the previous one. The tagstudio program 
in a relativly early stage of development and there is not a significant amount of information which made it hard to understand 
how the code worked, but that is similar to the previous project which also did not have a lot of documentation. 


## Effort spent

For each team member, how much time was spent in

1. plenary discussions/meetings;
Love: 2 hours

2. discussions within parts of the group;
Love: 2 hours

3. reading documentation;
Love 1 hour

4. configuration and setup;
The developers provided a requirements file which installed almost all of the required dependencies. We only had to download FFMPEG separely.
Love: 3 hours since I had to change to python 3.12 which broke my python install and making it work again took some time.

5. analyzing code/output;
Love: 1 hour.

6. writing documentation;
Love: 2 hours.

7. writing code;
Love: 15 hours

8. running code?
Love: 2 hours, first to find out what was wrong with the code and then to make sure that my changes did not break any other part of the code.

For setting up tools and libraries (step 4), enumerate all dependencies
you took care of and where you spent your time, if that time exceeds
30 minutes.

## Overall experience

What are your main take-aways from this project? What did you learn?

How did you grow as a team, using the Essence standard to evaluate yourself?

The experience we gained during the project is being comfortable using git and always writing tests to support your written code. 

By working with the issues we have gained insights about the construction of the project and how to improve other projects in the future.

We are currently in the “In-place” state, which is the same state as we were in the last project. We are comfortable in our communication and conscious of what we can expect from one another.  

Optional (point 6): How would you put your work in context with best software engineering practice?

Optional (point 7): Is there something special you want to mention here?
